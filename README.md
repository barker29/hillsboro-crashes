# Hillsboro Crashes

The goal of this project is to maintain data on crashes in Hillsboro, Oregon.

The [Transportation Committee](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/our-city/commissions-committees-boards) appointed by the City Council receives a monthly report on some crashes in the city. The data here is compiled from those reports.

The Oregon Department of Transportation has fairly comprehensive data, but it is very slow to update, often being almost two years out of date.

One inspiration for this work is Bike Portland's [Fatality Tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker), but that tool is restricted to Portland and this project is focused on Hillsboro.

An older version of this project had a broader focus of Washington County. Some of that data is still here in this repository.
