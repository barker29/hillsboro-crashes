# Washington County Oregon Crashes

The goal of this project is to maintain data on crashes in Washington County, Oregon.

The Oregon Department of Transportation has fairly comprehensive data, but it is very slow to update, often being almost two years out of date.

One inspiration for this work is Bike Portland's [Fatality Tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker), but that tool is restricted to Portland and this project is focused on Washington County.

I am looking for help adding to the data in `collected-data`, among other things.
