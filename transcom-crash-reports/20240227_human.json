The driver said the pedestrian seemed  as if \nthey were attempting to cross the street and did not see the vehicle approach.  \n\nA witness stated they were traveling south on NE 21st Ave and witnessed two subjects riding their skateboards in the middle of the road. The witness stated they observed a vehicle traveling northbound, the witness attempted to honk to signal the two indivi duals of the incoming vehicle.  \n The witness said the skateboarder closest to the middle of the road was struck by the vehicle which they then proceeded to pull over and check on the individual . \n Observation and measurements at crash scene did not indicate high speed as a factor in this crash.  \n Staff visited the location and found that lighting does exist at the location and did not find any obvious crash factors that would have led to the crash.  \n\nNo citations related to the crash were issued.  \n\n",
