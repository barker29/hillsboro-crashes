The speed \nposted on NE Jackson School Road was temporarily signed at 25 mph. Driver indicated that suddenly  3 \nchildren started to run across the crosswalk from west to east. The driver was u nable to stop in time \nand made contact with one of the children. The witness  on scene  stated that they believed that based \non how the children entered the roadway, a driver would not have had enough time to react to avoid a \ncollision , they also did not believe the driver was exceeding the speed limit .   \n The report does not indicate whether the driver was cited .  \n Staff visited the location and found that the beacon was operating properly. S taff also checked sight \ndistance at the beacon.   In this case  staff investigated stopping sight distance, ensuring the driver had \nadequate sight line to see, perceive, and stop for a pedestrian.   Sight distance needs are based on the \nspeed of the roadway.   While the speed at  this location is still under review, staff w as conservative and \nevaluated the location to ensure it met the speed limit of 35 mph as well as the temporary 30 mph \nspeed. Staff found the stopping sight distance to be adequate for a speed limit of 35 mph or below.\n\n ",
