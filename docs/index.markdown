Below is a list of all the fatalities in road crashes in Washington County, Oregon, in 2022.

It is loosely inspired by Bike Portland's [Fatality Tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker).

The data is gathered from various [sources](resources/) and may have omissions and mistakes. I appreciate any help keeping this up to date and accurate, see the [github page](https://github.com/barker29/washington-county-oregon-crashes) for how to help.
