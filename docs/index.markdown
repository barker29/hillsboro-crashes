This site is an attempt to do real-time tracking of car crashes in Hillsboro, Oregon.

## This site's past life

Previously, we attempted to track crashes throughout Washington County, not just in Hillsboro. That got to be too much to manage, but the old data is still available:

- Partial crash data from [2023](washington-county/)
- Archived data from [2022](washington-county/fatalities2022/) is also available.
