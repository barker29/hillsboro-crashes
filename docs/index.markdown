Below is a map and list of fatalities in road crashes in Washington County, Oregon, in 2023.

Archived data from [2022](fatalities2022/) is also available.

This project is loosely inspired by Bike Portland's [Fatality Tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker).

The data is gathered from various [sources](resources/) and may have omissions and mistakes. I appreciate any help keeping this up to date and accurate, see the [github page](https://github.com/barker29/washington-county-oregon-crashes) for how to help.
