This site is an attempt to do real-time tracking of car crashes in Hillsboro, Oregon.

The [Transportation Committee](https://www.hillsboro-oregon.gov/our-city/commissions-committees-boards) appointed by the City Council receives a monthly report on some crashes in the city. The data here is compiled from those reports.

## This site's past life

Previously, we attempted to track crashes throughout Washington County, not just in Hillsboro. That got to be too much to manage, but some old data is still available:

- Partial Washington County crash data from [2023](washington-county/)
- Archived Washington County data from [2022](washington-county/fatalities2022/).
