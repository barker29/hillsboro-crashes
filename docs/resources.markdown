This project has two inspirations: the [fatality tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker) from Bike Portland and Ben Fryback's [maps](https://osugisci.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=cacf2b375d35489b8fc1a46fbe83eb35) and [report](https://www.beavertonperspective.com/s/Pedestrian-Crash-Report.pdf) showing traffic violence in Washington County and throughout Oregon.

The most complete data on traffic violence is maintained by ODOT, but unfortunately it is not kept very up-to-date. ODOT data is what Fryback's report and maps are based on. My goal is to keep a current running list of at least the fatalities in Washington County.

There are a variety of sources for the data I collect, mostly media and government agencies. These sources include:

- The [Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/)
- [Pamplin Media](https://pamplinmedia.com/hillsboro-tribune-home/)
- [KOIN](https://www.koin.com)
- [KGW](https://www.kgw.com)
- Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue
- Hillsboro Fire Department
- [Washington County Sheriff's Office](https://www.washingtoncountyor.gov/sheriff/news)
- [Hillsboro Police](https://flashalert.net/id/HPD/)
- Monthly updates to the City of Hillsboro [Transportation Committee](https://hillsboro-oregon.civicweb.net/Portal/MeetingTypeList.aspx).

It is quite possible for something to slip through the cracks, so please let me know if the data is missing anything.
