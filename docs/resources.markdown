This project has two inspirations: the [fatality tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker) from Bike Portland and Ben Fryback's [report]() on traffic violence in Washington County.

The most complete data on traffic violence is maintained by ODOT. This is what Fryback's report and maps are based on. The only problem is that they report data over a year after the events in question; my goal is to have more up-to-date data.

There are a variety of sources for the data I collect, mostly media and government agencies. Some of them are:

- Oregonian
- TVF&R
- Hillsboro Fire
- Washington County Sheriff's Office
- Hillsboro Police
