This project has two inspirations: the [fatality tracker](https://bikeportland.org/fatality-tracker) from Bike Portland and Ben Fryback's [maps](https://osugisci.maps.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=cacf2b375d35489b8fc1a46fbe83eb35) and [report](https://www.beavertonperspective.com/s/Pedestrian-Crash-Report.pdf) showing traffic violence in Washington County and throughout Oregon.

The most complete data on traffic violence is maintained by ODOT. This is what Fryback's report and maps are based on. The only problem is that they report data over a year after the events in question; my goal is to have more up-to-date data.

There are a variety of sources for the data I collect, mostly media and government agencies. These sources include:

- The [Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/)
- [Pamplin Media](https://pamplinmedia.com/hillsboro-tribune-home/)
- TVF&R
- Hillsboro Fire
- [Washington County Sheriff's Office](https://www.washingtoncountyor.gov/sheriff/news)
- [Hillsboro Police](https://flashalert.net/id/HPD/)
- Monthly updates to the City of Hillsboro Transportation Committee.
